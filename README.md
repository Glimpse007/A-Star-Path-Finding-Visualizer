# A-Path-Finding-Visualizer
A python visualization of the A* path finding algorithm. It allows you to pick your start and end location and view the process of finding the shortest path, also in this implementation the wall can also be added which in problem solving terms can be called is barriers.
This is the visual implementation of how will the A* algorithm will find the shortest path in the maze.
## Some Screenshots of the Visualizer:
### Part 1 Nothing on the grid.
#### This is how the normal grid looks like!

### Part 2 This is how the calculation animation will occur! <br>
#### Running algorithm from orange(start point) to torquoise(end point).

### Part 3 Final solution is shown to the user.<br>
#### This is how the correct path will appear in purple color as default!
