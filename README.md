# A-Path-Finding-Visualizer
A python visualization of the A* path finding algorithm. It allows you to pick your start and end location and view the process of finding the shortest path, also in this implementation the wall can also be added which in problem solving terms can be called is barriers.
This is the visual implementation of how will the A* algorithm will find the shortest path in the maze.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TKinter
- Pygame
